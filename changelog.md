## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.7] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Docs-only maintenance release: CLAUDE.md versioning workflow rewritten (5 real version locations, release recipe, Pages-flake workaround; dead `ver_info.txt` dropped) + `.ai_state.md` session-close tidies. No application changes — the in-browser version intentionally remains v1.4.6.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- [docs/H132-Sonnet_SanskritKaraoke_AUDIO_DROP_RUNBOOK_02.07.26.md](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritKaraoke/blob/main/docs/H132-Sonnet_SanskritKaraoke_AUDIO_DROP_RUNBOOK_02.07.26.md) — audio-in-hand → scheduled-posts contract for the first chapter drop; MY_ROADMAP.md Phase 6 (Autonomous Production Run) defined.
- Subhāṣita verse feed: 10 curated short anuṣṭubh ślokas from Böhtlingk's *Indische
  Sprüche* (public domain), imported from VisualDCS `archive.sqlite` via
  `tools/import_subhashita.py` into `verses/data/subh_*.json`. Text-only (no audio yet);
  German kept as the explicitly-labelled translation. Verse schema extended additively
  with a German (`de`) translation branch and `source.attribution`.
- **Gloss layer in the student player (v1.4.6)**: word-by-word Sanskrit→RU glosses (`verse.glosses`, built 2026-06-26) now render as a collapsible «Пословный разбор» panel above the translation — IAST word on top, RU gloss beneath, auto-alignment disclaimer tooltip, collapse state persisted in localStorage, hidden in Dots/Blind study modes, RU/EN i18n headings.

### Fixed
- Translation box no longer renders empty for verses without a RU/EN translation: `updateTranslation` now falls back to any real language entry in `verse.translation` (metadata keys like `provenance`/`rights` excluded) and prefixes it with the language code — the German-only subhāṣita verses show "(DE) …"; the box hides entirely when no translation exists.
- **Student player was entirely broken since the ADR-0001 ES-module migration**: `student.html` loaded `app.js` without `type="module"` (parse error on the first `import`); `_applySession` was missing from the window-export block, so the `waitForApp` gate could never pass; a successful `runPipeline` wiped the student UI because `render()` clears `#main-area` and the audio/translation/quiz/SRS panels lived inside it (moved to a sibling `#student-panels` section); and the scheme auto-detect never ran for programmatically-set input, so the pipeline bailed on the empty scheme select. All four fixed; player verified end-to-end headless (wave + gloss + translation + Dots/Blind cycling + RU/EN toggle). `waitForApp` budget raised 2 s → 15 s for slow connections.
- Template↔deployed drift reconciled: the 2026-06-13 i18n/security/cache-bust fixes existed only in the deployed `student.html`; they are now in `tools/templates/student.html` (the source of truth), so regeneration no longer reverts them.
- `tools/render_chapter.js` never worked: it loaded `render.html` via `file://`, and Chromium blocks ES-module imports cross-origin from `file://` (every render timed out). Now serves the repo over an embedded localhost HTTP server. Found by the first synthetic end-to-end pipeline run (fake audio, 02-07-2026); all 3 sample verses now render 1080×1920 H.264 30 fps MP4 + SRT/VTT + thumbnail.
